GPT-3 model family: text-davinci-003. This model builds on top of our previous InstructGPT models, and improves on a number of behaviors that we’ve heard are important to you as developers.

text-davinci-003 includes the following improvements:

It produces higher quality writing. This will help your applications deliver clearer, more engaging, and more compelling content.

It can handle more complex instructions, meaning you can get even more creative with how you make use of its capabilities now.

It’s better at longer form content generation, allowing you to take on tasks that would have previously been too difficult to achieve.

To illustrate the improvements, check out the following example:
